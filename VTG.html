        <u><h1>Velocity Time Graphs</h1></u>
    </div>
    <div class="normtext">A velocity time graph plots velocity(v) on the y axis against time(t) on the x axis. Various values can be read and calculated from a distance time graph including velocity, time, distance and acceleration.<BR> The graph may be a straight line, a curved line or a mix of both.</div> 
    <br><br>
    <div class="subtitle">How to read and calculate off a velocity time graph</div>
    <ul> 
            <li> Time -  The time of a point on the graph is read from its value on the x axis. Remember to use the units from the graph. 

            </li><li> Velocity -  The velocity of a point on the graph is read from its value on the x axis. Remember to use the units from the graph. 
            
            </li><li> Acceleration - The acceleration of a point on a graph is found by calulating the gradient of the line (change in velocity / change in time). 
              <br>If the line is curved you will have to draw a tangent. 
            </li><li> Distance - The distance travelled between two points on the graph can be found by calculating the area under the line between those points.<br>
              The area is calculated using the values on the axes.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p class="example">
        A time where the velocity = 5m/s is 400s </p><p class="example">
        Velocity at 300s = 10m/s </p><p class="example">
        Acceleration at 300s = Gradient of the line at 300s</p><p class="example">
        - 15(change in velocity) / 300 (change in time) = -0.05 m/s<sup>2</sup>  
      </p><p class="example">
        Distance travelled between 100s and 200s = area under the line
      </p><p class="example">
        100 (time) x 15 (velocity) = 1500m (distance travelled)
