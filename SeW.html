    </div>
    <p class="subtitle">
        What are seismic waves?  
    </p>
    <p class="normtext">
        Seismic waves are shockwaves from earthquakes. They are detected using seismometers. 
    </p>
    <p class="normtext">
        The three types of wave produced are:
        <ul>
            <li>Primary (P) waves</li>
            <li>Secondary (S) waves</li>
            <li>Surface waves (not needed for GCSE)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="normtext">
        Primary waves are longitudinal and travel faster than secondary waves. They can travel through solids and liquids.
    </p>
    <p class="normtext">
        Secondary waves are transverse and travel slower than primary waves. They can only travel through solids.
    </p>

        Behaviour of seismic waves  
    </p><p class="normtext">
        <ul>
            <li>The speed of both types of wave increases with depth through the mantle  </li>
            <li>The waves travel in curved paths as their speed changes gradually through a material  </li>
            <li>When the state of the transmitting medium changes abruptly, e.g. when moving from solid to liquid, the wave direction also changes abruptly</li>
            <li>The change in direction because of a change in wave speed is called REFRACTION(covered in more detail in Y10)</li>
        </ul>
    </p></p></p><p class="subtitle">
        Determining the structure of the Earth  
    </p><p class="normtext">
        Scientists have made guesses about the structure of the Earth and then compared their predictions to seismic wave observations made on the surface.  
    </p>
    <img src="Images/SeW_D.png" alt = "Diagram showing secondary wave paths through the Earth" title="Diagram showing secondary wave paths through the Earth">
    <p class="normtext">
        From this we know that the Earth has a structure comprising of:
        <ul>
            <li>a thin crust</li>
            <li>a mantle, extending almost halfway to the Earth’s centre which has all the properties of a solid except that it can flow very slowly</li>
            <li>a core, with just over half of the Earth’s radius, made of nickel and iron the outer part of which is liquid and the inner part of which is solid</li>
        </ul>
